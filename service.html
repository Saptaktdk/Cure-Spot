                <p>People who are infected with <strong>coronavirus</strong> or have been around someone who is infected need to <a>stay home</a> to prevent spreading the virus. This is known as&nbsp;<a>quarantine or isolation</a>. Someone might need to do this if they have a COVID-19 infection, were in close contact with someone who's infected, or have returned from traveling and aren't yet fully vaccinated.</p>
                <h3>What Do We Need to Be Ready to Quarantine?</h3>
                <p>It's best to prepare before someone in your house gets sick. Here are some ways to stock up at home and be ready:</p>
                <ul >
                 <li><strong>Food and water.</strong> Choose food that doesn't need to be in the refrigerator and can stay good on the shelf for a long time. Buy canned foods and juices, rice, dried beans, granola bars, peanut butter, and dry cereal. Get baby foods, if needed. If you have pets, stock up on what they need.</li>
                 <li><strong>Foods your family likes when sick.</strong> These might include things like soup, crackers, and fluids to stay hydrated.</li>
                 <li><strong>Household supplies.</strong> Don't forget toilet paper, paper towels, shampoo, toothpaste, and dish soap.</li>
                 <li><strong>Medicines.</strong> Make sure prescriptions are filled and on hand. Get over-the-counter (nonprescription) fever reducers. Your doctor can advise you on how to use them.</li>
                 <li><strong>A <a>thermometer</a>.</strong> Depending on your child's age, you might need a digital thermometer, temporal artery thermometer, or electronic ear (tympanic) thermometer.</li>
                 <li><strong>Cleaning supplies.</strong> If someone is sick, regularly wipe down things that get touched a lot (like doorknobs, cellphones, and handles).</li>
                 <li><strong>Plenty of hand soap.</strong> Using soap and water to <a>wash hands</a> when staying home is best. You can use hand sanitizer if soap and water aren't available. Safely store hand sanitizer and cleaning products out of reach of the kids.</li>
                 <li><strong>Masks.</strong> Masks are important for going out. But they can also help stop the spread of COVID-19 at home.&nbsp;Indoors, anyone who is in quarantine or isolation should wear a mask when around others to prevent spreading the virus. Other household members should wear a mask when around the exposed or infected person. <strong>Children under 2 years old and people who can't take a mask off without help should not wear a mask.</strong></li>
                </ul>
                <p>The guidelines for how long to quarantine or isolate may differ from country to country, or may change over time as the virus changes or there’s new information about how it spreads. The CDC recently updated&nbsp;<a>its recommendations</a>&nbsp;for quarantine and isolation, but how and where they’re applied might vary.</p>

              <p>Animal bites and scratches, even minor ones, can sometimes lead to complications. Whether the animal is a family pet (in kids, most animal bites that are reported are from <a>dogs</a>) or a creature from the wild, scratches and bites can carry disease.</p> 
<p>Some bites, especially from cats, can get infected by bacteria from the animal's mouth. And <a>cat scratch disease</a>, a bacterial infection, can develop from a cat scratch (usually from a kitten) even if the scratch site doesn't look infected. Some animals — such as bats, raccoons, and foxes — can spread <a>rabies</a>.</p> 
<p>Kids whose tetanus shots are not up to date will need a shot (post-exposure tetanus prophylaxis) after an animal bite to prevent <a>tetanus infection</a>.</p> 
<p><a></a></p> 
<h2>What to Do:</h2> 
<ul class="kh_longline_list"> 
 <li>If the bite or scratch wound is <a>bleeding</a>, apply pressure to the area with a clean bandage or towel until the bleeding stops. If available, use clean latex or rubber gloves to protect yourself and to prevent the wound from getting infected.</li> 
 <li>If the wound is not bleeding heavily, clean it with soap and water, and hold it under running water for several minutes.</li> 
 <li>Dry the wound, apply antibiotic ointment,&nbsp;and cover it with sterile gauze or a clean cloth.</li> 
 <li>Call your doctor if the bite or scratch broke or punctured the skin, even if the area is small. A child who is bitten by an animal may need antibiotics, a tetanus booster, or rarely, a series of rabies shots. A bite or scratch on a child's face, hand, or foot is particularly at risk for infection and should be checked by your doctor as soon as possible.</li> 
 <li>If your child was bitten or scratched by an unfamiliar or wild animal, note the location of the animal. Some animals may have to be captured, confined, and observed for rabies. But do <strong>not</strong> try to capture the animal yourself. Instead, call the animal control office or animal warden in your area.</li> 
 <li>Get immediate medical care if: 
  <ul class="kh_longline_list"> 
   <li>the wound is on the face, neck, hand, foot, or near a joint</li> 
   <li>the wound won't stop bleeding after 10 minutes of direct pressure</li> 
   <li>the wound appears to be deep, large, or severe</li> 
   <li>the attacking animal was stray or wild or behaving strangely</li> 
   <li>the bite or scratch has pus coming from it, or becomes red, hot, swollen, or increasingly painful</li> 
   <li>your child has a weakened <a>immune system</a> or other medical condition that might make an infection more likely</li> 
   <li>your child's tetanus immunizations are not up to date</li> 
  </ul> </li> 
</ul> 
<p>Teach your children to stay away from strange animals, and not to tease or provoke any animals, even family pets. Animals should not be disturbed while they are eating or sleeping.</p> 
<p>If you own a pet, make sure it's properly immunized and licensed.</p>

              <p>What’s the difference between insect bites and insect stings? A <strong>bite</strong> is when an insect (like a mosquito, flea, or bedbug) uses its mouth to break a person’s skin, usually so it can feed. Insect bites usually itch. A <strong>sting</strong> is when an insect uses another body part, such as a barbed stinger at its tail end, to pierce the skin and inject venom (like a poison). They usually do this in self-defense. Stings are more painful than bites.</p> 
<p>Bites and stings usually are just annoying, causing temporary discomfort and pain, but no serious or lasting health problems. Sometimes, though, they can cause infections that need quick medical treatment and allergic reactions that can be serious, even fatal.</p> 
<p>So parents should know the signs of an infection or allergic reaction, and when to get medical care. Tell all caregivers if a child has any history of problems so they know what to do if a child gets a bite or sting.</p>

<h3>How Can We Prevent Bites and Stings?</h3> 
<p>Here are some ways to protect your family from insect bites and stings:</p> 
<ul class="kh_longline_list"> 
 <li>Avoid mosquito bites by staying away from areas where mosquitoes breed, such as still pools or ponds, during hot weather. Remove standing water from birdbaths, buckets, etc. Try to stay inside when mosquitoes are most active (dawn and dusk). Apply insect repellent when kids go outside.</li> 
 <li>When in tick country, stay in the center of trails, avoiding woody areas with high grass. Check kids for ticks every few hours and as soon as you come inside. <a>Remove</a> any you find right away. The most important places to check are behind the ears, on the scalp, on the back of the neck, in the armpits, in the groin area, and behind the knees. Have kids shower as soon as they come in from outdoors. Check your pets when they come inside too. Use tick products on pets to prevent them from bites.</li> 
 <li>Use <a>insect repellent</a> when spending time outdoors camping, hiking, etc. Repellents that contain 10% to 30% DEET (N,N-diethyl-meta-toluamide) are approved for mosquitoes, ticks, and some other bugs. Repellents that contain picaridin (KBR 3023) or oil of lemon eucalyptus (p-menthane 3,8-diol or PMD) are effective against mosquitoes. Follow the instructions carefully. Check what ages the product is appropriate for, and don't overuse it — using more than is needed won't provide any extra protection. Reapply insect repellent according to the directions after swimming.</li> 
 <li>When you or your kids are in wooded areas, tuck clothes in and keep as covered up as possible. Tuck pants into socks and shirts into pants. Wear shoes and socks when walking on grass, even it's just for a minute. Bees and wasps can sting unprotected feet.</li> 
 <li>Wear gloves when gardening.</li> 
 <li>Don't disturb bee or wasp nests.</li> 
 <li>Don't swat at buzzing insects — they will sting if they feel threatened.</li> 
 <li>Be aware that spiders might be hiding in undisturbed piles of wood, seldom-opened boxes, or corners behind furniture, and proceed with caution.</li> 
 <li>Prevent flea infestations by treating your house (including all carpets, furniture, and pets) regularly during the warmer months. Vacuuming often also can help.</li>

            <h3>What Are Common Causes of Burns?</h3> 
<p>The first step in helping to protect kids from burns is to understand how common burns happen:</p> 
<ul class="kh_longline_list"> 
 <li><strong>Thermal burns:</strong> These burns raise the temperature of the skin and tissue underneath. Thermal burns happen from steam, <a>hot bath water</a>, tipped-over coffee cups, hot foods, cooking fluids, etc.</li> 
 <li><strong>Radiation burns:</strong> These happen from exposure to the sun's ultraviolet rays (a <a>sunburn</a> because skin isn't well-protected in the sun) or from radiation such as during an X-ray.</li> 
 <li><strong>Chemical burns:</strong> These happen from swallowing strong acids (like drain cleaner or <a>button batteries</a>) or spilling chemicals (like bleach) onto the skin or eyes.</li> 
 <li><strong>Electrical burns:</strong> These are from contact with <a>electrical current</a> and can happen from things like biting on electrical cords or sticking fingers or objects in electrical outlets, etc.</li> 
</ul> 
<h3>What Are the Types of Burns?</h3> 
<p>Knowing the type of burn a child has can help with first-aid measures. All burns should be treated quickly to lower the temperature of the burned area and reduce damage to the skin and tissue underneath (if the burn is severe).</p> 
<h4>First-Degree (Superficial) Burns</h4> 
<p>Superficial (shallow) burns are the mildest type of burns. They're limited to the top layer of skin:</p> 
<ul class="kh_longline_list"> 
 <li><strong>Signs and symptoms:</strong> These burns cause redness, pain, and minor swelling. The skin is dry without blisters.</li> 
 <li><strong>Healing time:</strong> Healing time is about 3–6 days; the superficial skin layer over the burn may peel off in 1 or 2 days.</li> 
</ul> 
<h4>Second-Degree (Partial Thickness) Burns</h4> 
<p>These burns are more serious and involve the top layer of skin and part of the layer below it.&nbsp;</p> 
<ul class="kh_longline_list"> 
 <li><strong>Signs and symptoms:</strong> The burned area is red and blistered, and can swell and be painful. The blisters sometimes break open and the area is wet looking with a bright pink to cherry red color.</li> 
 <li><strong>Healing time:</strong> Healing time varies depending on the severity of the burn. It can take up to 3 weeks or longer.</li> 
</ul> 
<h4>Full Thickness Burns</h4> 
<p>These burns (also called <strong>third-degree burns</strong> or <strong>fourth-degree burns</strong>) are the most serious type of burn. They involve all layers of the skin and the nerve endings there, and may go into underlying tissue.</p> 
<ul class="kh_longline_list"> 
 <li><strong>Signs and symptoms:</strong> The surface appears dry and can look waxy white, leathery, brown, or charred. There may be little or no pain or the area may feel numb at first because of nerve damage.</li> 
 <li><strong>Healing time:</strong> Healing time depends on the severity of the burn. Most need to be treated with skin grafts, in which healthy skin is taken from another part of the body and surgically placed over the burn wound to help the area heal.</li> 
</ul> 
<h3>What Should We Do for Burns?</h3> 
<h4>Get medical help right away when:</h4> 
<ul class="kh_longline_list"> 
 <li>You think your child has any burn other than a superficial one.</li> 
 <li>The burned area is large (2–3 inches wide), even if it seems like a minor burn. For any burn that appears to cover a large part of the body, call for medical help. Do not use wet compresses or ice because they can cause the child's body temperature to drop. Instead, cover the area with a clean, soft cloth or towel.</li> 
 <li>The burn comes from a fire, an electrical wire, a socket, or chemicals.</li> 
 <li>The burn is on the face, scalp, hands, genitals, or on skin over a joint.</li> 
 <li>The burn looks infected (with swelling, pus, increasing redness, or red streaking of the skin near the wound).</li> 
</ul> 
<h4>For superficial burns:</h4> 
<ul class="kh_longline_list"> 
 <li>Remove the child from the heat source and take clothing off the burned area right away.</li> 
 <li>Run cool (not cold) water over the burned area (if water isn't available, any cold, drinkable fluid can be used) or hold a clean, cold compress on the burn for 3–5 minutes (do not use ice, which can cause more damage to the injured skin).</li> 
 <li>Do not apply butter, grease, powder, or any other "folk" remedies to the burn, as these can make the burn deeper and increase the risk of infection.</li> 
 <li>Apply aloe gel or cream to the affected area. This may be done a few times during the day.</li> 
 <li>Give your child <a>acetaminophen</a> or <a>ibuprofen</a> for pain. Follow the label directions for how much to give and how often.</li> 
 <li>Keep the affected area clean. You can protect it with a sterile gauze pad or bandage for the next 24 hours. Do not put adhesive bandages on very young kids, though, as these can be a choking hazard if they get loose.</li> 
</ul> 
<h4>For partial thickness burns and full thickness burns:</h4> 
<p><strong>Call for emergency medical care.</strong> Then, follow these steps until help arrives:</p> 
<ul class="kh_longline_list"> 
 <li>Keep the child lying down with the burned area raised.</li> 
 <li>Follow the instructions for first-degree burns.</li> 
 <li>Remove all jewelry and clothing from around the burn (in case there's any swelling after the injury), except for clothing that's stuck to the skin. If you have trouble removing clothing, you may need to cut it off or wait until medical help arrives.</li> 
 <li>Do not break any blisters.</li> 
 <li>Apply cool water over the area for at least 3–5 minutes, then cover the area with a clean dry cloth or sheet until help arrives.</li> 
</ul> 
<h4>For electrical and chemical burns:</h4> 
<ul class="kh_longline_list"> 
 <li>Make sure the child is not in contact with the electrical source before touching him or her, or you also may get shocked.</li> 
 <li>For chemical burns, flush the area with lots of running water for 5 minutes or more. If the burned area is large, use a tub, shower, buckets of water, or a garden hose.</li> 
 <li>Do not remove any of the child's clothing before you've begun flushing the burn with water. As you continue flushing the burn, you can then remove clothing from the burned area.</li> 
 <li>If the burned area from a chemical is small, flush for another 10–20 minutes, apply a sterile gauze pad or bandage, and call your doctor.</li> 
 <li>Chemical burns to the mouth or eyes need to be checked by a doctor right away after being thoroughly flushed with water.</li> 
</ul> 
<p>Chemical burns and electrical burns might not always be visible, but can be serious because of possible damage to internal organs. Symptoms may vary, depending on the type and severity of the burn and what caused it.</p> 
<p>If you think your child may have swallowed a chemical substance or an object that could be harmful (for instance, a button battery), first call <strong>poison control at (800) 222-1222</strong>. Then, call 911 for emergency medical help.</p> 
<p>It helps to know what chemical product the child has swallowed or has been exposed to. You may need to take it with you to the hospital.</p>

          <h3>What to Do:</h3> 
          <h4>For Minor Bleeding From a Small Cut or Scrape:</h4> 
          <ul class="kh_longline_list"> 
           <li>Rinse the wound thoroughly with water to clean out dirt and debris.</li> 
           <li>Wash the wound with a mild soap and rinse well. (For minor wounds, you don't need to use an antiseptic solution to prevent infection, and some can cause allergic skin reactions.)</li> 
           <li>Cover the wound with a sterile adhesive bandage or sterile gauze and adhesive tape.</li> 
           <li>If the bandage gets wet, remove it and apply a new one. After the wound forms a scab, a bandage isn't needed.</li> 
           <li>Check the wound daily.</li> 
           <li>Call your doctor if the wound is red, swollen, tender, warm, or draining pus.</li> 
          </ul> 
          <h4>For Bleeding From a Large or Deep Cut or Tear:</h4> 
          <ul class="kh_longline_list"> 
           <li>Rinse off the wound with water so you can see it clearly and check its size.</li> 
           <li>Place a piece of sterile gauze or a clean cloth over the entire wound. If available, wear clean latex or rubber gloves.</li> 
           <li>If you can, raise the bleeding body part above the level of the child's heart. Do <strong>not</strong> apply a tourniquet.</li> 
           <li>Using the palm of your hand on the gauze or cloth, apply steady, direct pressure to the wound for 5 minutes. (During the 5 minutes, do <strong>not</strong> stop to check the wound or remove blood clots that may form on the gauze.)</li> 
           <li>If blood soaks through the gauze, do <strong>not</strong> remove it. Apply another gauze pad on top and continue applying pressure.</li> 
          </ul> 
          <p>Call your doctor or get immediate medical care for all large or cuts or tears, or if:</p> 
          <ul class="kh_longline_list"> 
           <li>you can't stop the bleeding after 5 minutes of pressure, or if the wound begins bleeding again (continue applying pressure until help arrives)</li> 
           <li>you can't clean out dirt and debris thoroughly, or there's something else stuck in the wound</li> 
           <li>the wound is on the child's face or neck</li> 
           <li>the injury was caused by an animal or human bite, a burn, electrical injury, or puncture wound (e.g., a nail)</li> 
           <li>the cut is more than half an inch long or appears to be deep — large or deep wounds can result in nerve or tendon damage</li> 
          </ul> 
          <p>If you have any doubt about whether stitches are needed, call your doctor.</p>

          <h3>What Is Choking?</h3> 
<p>When a child is choking, it means that an object — usually food or a toy — is stuck in the <script type="text/javascript" id="splatJS_trachea_T" name="splat" src="/content/kidshealth/us/en/parents/splats/trachea.js"></script><script type="text/javascript" id="splatDW_trachea_T">document.write(def_trachea_T);</script>
 <noscript class="rs_skip">
  trachea</noscript>(the airway). When this happens, air can't flow normally into or out of the lungs, so the child can't breathe properly.</p> 
<p>The trachea is usually protected by a small flap of tissue called the <script type="text/javascript" id="splatJS_epiglottis_T" name="splat" src="/content/kidshealth/us/en/parents/splats/epiglottis.js"></script><script type="text/javascript" id="splatDW_epiglottis_T">document.write(def_epiglottis_T);</script>
 <noscript class="rs_skip">
  epiglottis</noscript>. The trachea and the <script type="text/javascript" id="splatJS_esophagus_T" name="splat" src="/content/kidshealth/us/en/parents/splats/esophagus.js"></script><script type="text/javascript" id="splatDW_esophagus_T">document.write(def_esophagus_T);</script>
 <noscript class="rs_skip">
  esophagus</noscript>share an opening at the back of the throat. The epiglottis acts like a lid, snapping shut over the trachea each time a person swallows. It allows food to pass down the esophagus and prevents it from going down the trachea.</p> 
<p>But every once in a while, the epiglottis doesn't close fast enough and an object can slip into the trachea. This is what happens when something "goes down the wrong pipe."</p> 
<p>Most of the time, the food or object only partially blocks the trachea, is coughed up, and breathing returns to normal quickly. Kids who seem to be choking and coughing but still can breathe and talk usually recover without help. It can be uncomfortable and upsetting for them, but they're generally fine after a few seconds.</p> 
<h3>Is Choking an Emergency?</h3> 
<p>Sometimes, an object can get into the trachea and completely block the airway. If airflow into and out of the lungs is blocked and the brain is deprived of oxygen, choking can become a life-threatening emergency.</p> 
<p>A child may be choking and need help right away if he or she:<a></a></p> 
<ul> 
 <li>can't breathe</li> 
 <li>is gasping or wheezing</li> 
 <li>can't talk, cry, or make noise</li> 
 <li>turns blue</li> 
 <li>grabs at his or her throat or waves arms</li> 
 <li>appears panicked</li> 
 <li>becomes limp or unconscious</li> 
</ul> 
<p>In these cases, if you've been trained, immediately start abdominal thrusts (also known as the Heimlich maneuver), the standard rescue procedure for choking.</p> 
<h3>What Are Abdominal Thrusts (the Heimlich Maneuver)?</h3> 
<p>If you have kids, it's important to get trained in both <a>cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR)</a> and the technique of abdominal thrusts (the Heimlich maneuver). Even if you don't have kids, knowing how to perform these first-aid procedures will let you help if someone is choking.</p> 
<p>When a person does abdominal thrusts, a sudden burst of air is forced upward through the trachea from the diaphragm and will dislodge a foreign object and send it flying up into (or even out of) the mouth.</p> 
<p>Though the technique is pretty simple, abdominal thrusts must be done with caution, especially on young children. They are&nbsp;safest when done by someone trained to do them. If done the wrong way, the choking person — especially a baby or child — could be hurt. There's a special version of abdominal thrusts just for infants that is designed to lower the risk of injury to their small bodies.</p> 
<p>The technique of abdominal thrusts and CPR are usually taught as part of basic first-aid courses, which are offered by YMCAs, hospitals, and local chapters of the American Heart Association (AHA) and the American Red Cross.</p> 
<h3>What Should I Do?</h3> 
<p>Call 911 for any serious choking situation.</p> 
<p>Here are several possible situations you might face and tips on how to handle them:</p> 
<p><strong>If a child is choking and coughing but can breathe and talk</strong>:</p> 
<ul class="kh_longline_list"> 
 <li>This means the airway is not completely blocked. It's best to do nothing. Watch the child carefully and make sure he or she&nbsp;recovers completely. The child will likely be fine after a good coughing spell.</li> 
 <li>Don't reach into the mouth to grab the object or even pat the child on the back. Either of these steps could push the object farther down the airway and make the situation worse.</li> 
 <li>Stay with the child and remain calm until the episode passes.</li> 
</ul> 
<p><strong>If a child is conscious but can't breathe, talk, or make noise, or is turning blue:</strong></p> 
<ul class="kh_longline_list"> 
 <li>The situation calls for abdominal thrusts.</li> 
 <li>Call 911 or tell someone nearby to call 911 immediately.</li> 
 <li>Begin the thrusts if you've been trained to do so.</li> 
 <li>If you haven't been trained, and no one else is available who has been, wait until help arrives.</li> 
</ul> 
<p><strong>If the child was choking and is now unconscious and no longer breathing:</strong></p> 
<ul class="kh_longline_list"> 
 <li>Shout for help and call 911, or tell someone nearby to call 911 immediately.</li> 
 <li>Start CPR right away, if you've been trained in it.</li> 
 <li>If you have not been trained, and no one else is available who has been, wait until help arrives.</li> 
</ul> 
<h3>When Should I Call the Doctor or Go to the ER?</h3> 
<p>After any major choking episode, a child needs to go to the ER.</p> 
<p>Get emergency medical care for a child if:</p> 
<ul class="kh_longline_list"> 
 <li>The child has a lasting cough, drooling, gagging, wheezing, trouble swallowing, or trouble breathing.</li> 
 <li>The child turned blue, became limp, or was unconscious during the episode, even if he or she seemed to recover.</li> 
 <li>You think the child has swallowed an object, such as a toy or battery.</li> 
</ul> 
<p>If a child had an episode that seemed like choking but fully recovered after a coughing spell, there is no need to get emergency medical care, but you should call your doctor.</p> 
<h3>How Can We Prevent Choking?</h3> 
<p>All kids are at risk for choking, but those younger than 3 are especially at risk. Young kids tend to put things in their mouths, have smaller airways that are easily blocked, and don't have a lot of experience chewing, so they might swallow things whole.</p> 
<p>To help <a>protect kids</a>:</p> 
<ul class="kh_longline_list"> 
 <li>Avoid foods that pose choking risks (like hot dogs, grapes, raw carrots, nuts, raisins, hard or gummy candy, spoonfuls of peanut butter, chunks of meat or cheese, and popcorn), which are a similar size and shape as a child's airway.</li> 
 <li>At mealtime, be sure to serve a child's food in small bites. That means cutting whole grapes into quarters, cutting hot dogs lengthwise and into pieces (and remove the tough skin), and cooking vegetables rather than serving them raw. Teach kids to sit down for all meals and snacks and not to talk or laugh with food in their mouths.</li> 
 <li>Toys and household items also can be choking hazards — beware of deflated balloons, coins, beads, small toy parts, and batteries. Get down on the floor often to check for objects that kids who are learning to walk or crawl could put in their mouths and choke on.</li> 
 <li>Choose safe, age-appropriate <a>toys</a>. Always follow the manufacturer's age recommendations — some toys have small parts that can cause choking. To determine if a toy is too small, see if it passes easily through an empty cardboard toilet paper tube. If it does, it's too small.</li>

          <p>Here's how to prevent&nbsp;— and be ready for — <a>fires</a> in your home.</p> 
          <h3>Fire Extinguishers</h3> 
          <p>Be prepared for small fires by having fire extinguishers placed around your home. Be sure to have:</p> 
          <ul> 
           <li>at least one on each floor</li> 
           <li>one in the kitchen (this should be one that can be used on grease and electrical fires)</li> 
           <li>one in the basement, the garage, and any workshop area</li> 
          </ul> 
          <p>If you live in apartment building, ask the landlord to show you the fire extinguishers.</p> 
          <p>Always keep fire extinguishers out of reach of children.</p> 
          <h3>When Should We Use a Fire Extinguisher?</h3> 
          <p>Fire extinguishers are best used when a fire is contained in a small area, like a wastebasket, and when the fire department has already been called.</p> 
          <h3>How Should We Use a Fire Extinguisher?</h3> 
          <p>Use the word PASS to make it easier to know how use an extinguisher:</p> 
          <ul class="kh_longline_list"> 
           <li><strong>P</strong>ull the pin. Release the lock with the nozzle pointing away from you.</li> 
           <li><strong>A</strong>im low. Point the extinguisher at the bottom of the fire.</li> 
           <li><strong>S</strong>queeze the lever slowly and evenly.</li> 
           <li><strong>S</strong>weep the nozzle from side to side.</li> 
          </ul> 
          <p>The best time to learn how to use a fire extinguisher is now, before you ever need it. Fire extinguishers have gauges on them that show you when they need to be replaced. Check them regularly to make sure they're still working correctly.&nbsp;If you live in an apartment, be sure to check in with the landlord. If you have any questions, the local fire department can help.</p> 
          <p>If you're ever in doubt about whether to use an extinguisher on a fire, don't try it. Instead, leave your home right away and call the fire department.</p> 
          <h3>Teaching Kids the Facts About Fire</h3> 
          <p>Unfortunately, many kids will try to hide from a fire, often in a closet, under a bed, or in a corner. By teaching them basic fire safety facts, they'll be better able to protect themselves.</p> 
          <p>Teach your kids that:</p> 
          <ul class="kh_longline_list"> 
           <li>Fires spread quickly.</li> 
           <li>Most fire-related deaths are not from <a>burns</a>, but from smoke inhalation.</li> 
           <li>Dangerous fumes can overcome a person in just a few minutes.</li> 
          </ul> 
          <p>Kids should learn to:</p> 
          <ul class="kh_longline_list"> 
           <li>Cover their mouths and noses with a moist towel or an article of clothing to keep out dangerous fumes while evacuating.</li> 
           <li>Crawl under the smoke to safety, staying as low to the ground as possible (smoke always rises).</li> 
           <li>Touch any door (not the doorknob) to see if it is hot. If it is, they should not open it — find another exit.</li> 
           <li>Locate the nearest stairway marked "Fire Exit" if they live in an apartment building, or a fire escape if the stairway isn't accessible.</li> 
           <li>Avoid elevators during a fire.</li> 
           <li>Never stop to take personal belongings or pets or to make a phone call (even to 911) while evacuating.</li> 
           <li>Never go back into a burning building once safely outside.</li> 
           <li>Stop, drop, and roll to put out flames if an article of clothing catches fire.</li> 
          </ul> 
          <h3>Practice Fire Drills at Home</h3> 
          <p>Kids have fire drills at school and adults have them at work. Fires are scary and can cause panic. By rehearsing different situations, your family will be better prepared in the event of a fire at home.&nbsp;If relatives are at your home often, include them in the fire drills.&nbsp; If you live in an apartment, ask when fire drills are scheduled.</p> 
          <h4>Plan Escape Routes:</h4> 
          <p>Be sure to plan escape routes, especially in case a fire were to happen at night.</p> 
          <ul class="kh_longline_list"> 
           <li>Plan possible exits for each room in your house.</li> 
           <li>Think of two escape routes from each room, in case one is blocked by fire.</li> 
           <li>Check the room to make sure that furniture and other objects are not blocking doorways or windows.</li> 
           <li>Be sure you know the locations of the closest stairwells or fire escapes and where they lead.</li> 
           <li>Practice the escape routes for each room.</li> 
           <li>Decide on a safe meeting place outside your house or apartment building.</li> 
           <li>Be sure any <a>babysitters</a> in your home know all escape routes and plans in case of a fire.</li> 
           <li>Test your plan to see if everyone can be out of the house and at the safe meeting place within 3 minutes.</li> 
          </ul> 
          <h4>Check Windows:</h4> 
          <p>Make sure that the windows in every room are easy to open and are not painted over or nailed shut. This may be your only way out in a fire. If you live in an apartment building, make sure any safety bars on windows are removable in an emergency.</p> 
          <h4>Check Escape Ladders:</h4> 
          <p>If your house is more than one story tall or if you live above the ground floor of an apartment building, it's important to have an escape ladder.</p> 
          <p>The escape ladder:</p> 
          <ul> 
           <li>should be in each upper story bedroom occupied by a person capable of using it</li> 
           <li>must be made of fire-safe material like aluminum, not rope</li> 
           <li>should be operated by adults only</li> 
           <li>must be approved by an independent testing laboratory</li> 
           <li>should be of appropriate length for your home</li> 
           <li>must support the weight of the heaviest adult in the home</li> 
          </ul>

          <h3>What Are Head Injuries?</h3> 
<p>Head injuries are common in children and teens. They can hurt the scalp, skull, brain, or blood vessels.</p> 
<p>Head injuries can be mild, like a bump on the head, or more serious, like a concussion. In kids, most are mild and don't injure the <a>brain</a>.</p> 
<h3>What Causes Head Injuries?</h3> 
<p>Most head injuries in childhood are due to <a>falls</a>. They also happen from:</p> 
<ul> 
 <li>car crashes</li> 
 <li>bike accidents</li> 
 <li><a>sports injuries</a></li> 
 <li><a>child abuse</a></li> 
</ul> 
<h3>What Are the Types of Head Injuries?</h3> 
<p>Head injuries can be:&nbsp;</p> 
<ul> 
 <li><strong>external</strong> and involve the scalp</li> 
 <li><strong>internal</strong> and involve the skull, brain, or blood vessels</li> 
</ul> 
<p>An injury can cause a concussion, contusion, fracture, or bleeding:</p> 
<ul class="kh_longline_list"> 
 <li>A <a><strong>concussion</strong></a> is a type of mild traumatic brain injury. It happens when a blow to the head or another injury moves the head back and forth with a lot of force. This causes chemical changes in the brain and sometimes damages brain cells.</li> 
 <li>A <strong>contusion (bruise)</strong> happens when a blow to the head injures the skin and the soft tissue under it. Blood from small blood vessels leaks, causing red or purple marks on the skin. Contusions often happen on the scalp or forehead. More serious head injuries can cause a brain contusion.</li> 
 <li>A <strong>skull fracture</strong> is a <a>break</a> in the skull bone. Skull fractures can happen in different parts of the skull.</li> 
 <li><strong>Bleeding</strong> can happen on and under the scalp and in or around the brain.&nbsp;</li> 
</ul> 
<h3>What Are the Signs &amp; Symptoms of a Head Injury?</h3> 
<p>A child with a head injury might:</p> 
<ul class="kh_longline_list"> 
 <li><strong>Have a swollen scalp:</strong> This is common because the scalp has many small blood vessels that can leak.</li> 
 <li><strong>Have a <a>headache</a>:</strong> About half of children with a head injury get a headache.</li> 
 <li><strong>Lose consciousness (pass out):</strong> This isn't common.</li> 
 <li><strong><a>Vomit</a> once or twice:</strong> This happens in some children after a head injury.</li> 
</ul> 
<h3>How Are Head Injuries Diagnosed?</h3> 
<p>Doctors diagnose head injuries by asking questions about how the injury happened and doing a careful exam of the head. They'll also check to see how the nerves are working.</p> 
<p>Most children with a mild brain injury don't need medical tests. Doctors often do a&nbsp;<a>CAT scan</a> of the head if the injury is more serious.</p> 
<p>Signs that the injury could be serious include:</p> 
<ul> 
 <li>loss of consciousness for more than a few minutes</li> 
 <li>continued vomiting</li> 
 <li>confusion</li> 
 <li><a>seizures</a></li> 
 <li>a headache that gets worse</li> 
</ul> 
<h3>What Should I Do When a Child Has a Head Injury?</h3> 
<p>Call your health care provider right away if your child had a head injury and:</p> 
<ul> 
 <li>is an infant</li> 
 <li>lost consciousness, even for a moment</li> 
 <li>has any of these symptoms: 
  <ul> 
   <li>won't stop crying</li> 
   <li>complains of head and neck pain (younger children who aren't talking yet may be more fussy)</li> 
   <li>vomits more than one time</li> 
   <li>won't awaken easily</li> 
   <li>becomes hard to comfort</li> 
   <li>isn't walking or talking normally</li> 
  </ul> </li> 
</ul> 
<p>If your child is not an infant, has not lost consciousness, and is alert and behaving normally after the fall or blow:</p> 
<ul class="kh_longline_list"> 
 <li>Put an ice pack or instant cold pack on the injured area for 20 minutes every 3–4 hours. If you use ice, always wrap it in a washcloth or sock. Ice placed right on bare skin can injure it.</li> 
 <li>Watch your child carefully for the next 24 hours. If the injury happens close to bedtime or naptime and your child falls asleep soon afterward, check in a few times while they sleep.</li> 
</ul> 
<p>If your child's skin color and breathing are <strong>normal</strong>, and you don't sense a problem, let your child sleep unless the doctor tells you otherwise. There's <strong>no need</strong> to keep a child awake after a head injury.</p> 
<p><strong>Trust your instincts.</strong> If you think your child doesn't look or seem right, partly awaken your child by sitting them up. They should fuss a bit and attempt to resettle. If your child still seems very drowsy, try to awaken them fully. If you can't wake your child, call your health care provider or <a>911 for an ambulance</a>.</p> 
<h3>What Should I Do if a Child Is Unconscious After a Head Injury?</h3> 
<ul class="kh_longline_list"> 
 <li>Don't move the child in case there is a neck or spine injury.</li> 
 <li>Call for help. If you have a phone with you, call 911.</li> 
 <li>If the child is vomiting or having a <a>seizure</a>, turn them onto their side while trying to keep the head and neck straight. This will help prevent <a>choking</a> and protect the neck and spine.</li> 
</ul> 
<h3>Can Head Injuries Be Prevented?</h3> 
<p>It's impossible to protect kids from every injury. But you can help prevent head blows. Most important, <a>childproof</a> your home to prevent household accidents.</p> 
<p>Kids should:</p> 
<ul class="kh_longline_list"> 
 <li>Always wear a <a>bike helmet</a> that fits well and is approved by the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission for biking.</li> 
 <li>Use the proper sports equipment for inline skating, <a>skateboarding</a>, <a>snowboarding</a>, <a>skiing</a>, and contact sports.</li> 
 <li>Use a child <a>safety seat</a> or seatbelt every time they're in the car.</li> 
 <li>Take it easy after a head injury, especially if they had a concussion.</li> 
 <li>Wait until the doctor says it's OK before returning to rough play or sports. If the brain gets injured again while it's still healing, it will take even longer to completely heal.</li>

<p><strong><a>Frostbite</a></strong> is a skin injury caused by freezing temperatures. Sometimes it also injures deeper tissue. Serious frostbite can go all the way down to the muscles and bones.</p> 
<h3>What Are the Signs &amp; Symptoms of Frostbite?</h3>

 <li>Get your child into dry clothing in a warm environment.</li> 
</ul> 
<p>If you can't get to a hospital right away or must wait for an ambulance, give your child a warm drink and begin <a>first-aid</a> treatment:</p> 
<ul class="kh_longline_list"> 
 <li>Do not thaw the frostbitten area if it's at risk for refreezing before you get to a health care provider. Skin that is thawed then refrozen again can cause severe tissue damage.</li> 
 <li>Put frozen areas in warm water (around 100°F [38°C]). If warm water is not available, wrap your child gently in warm blankets or use your body heat on the affected area.</li> 
 <li>Do not use direct heat such as a fire or heating pad. The skin may be numb and can burn easily.</li> 
 <li>Do not rub frostbitten skin or rub snow on it.</li> 
 <li>Rewarming will bring on a burning sensation. Skin may blister and swell and may turn red, blue, or purple. When skin is pink and no longer numb, the area is thawed.</li> 
 <li>If you have sterile dressings, put them on the area (be sure it's not too tight), placing it between fingers and toes if they are affected. Try not to disturb any blisters and keep the wound areas clean to prevent infection.</li> 
 <li>Wrap rewarmed areas to prevent refreezing, and have your child keep thawed areas as still as possible. If you have the proper first-aid training, splinting the affected area can help reduce the risk of further injury.</li> 
</ul> 
<h3>Can Frostbite Be Prevented?</h3> 
<p>To help prevent frostbite in cold weather:</p> 
<ul class="kh_longline_list"> 
 <li>Stay updated on weather forecasts. If it's extremely cold, even brief exposure to cold can cause frostbite.</li> 
 <li>Dress kids in layered warm clothes. Use hats, gloves, scarves, thick socks, and well-insulated boots to cover body parts that are most at risk for frostbite. Inner clothing layers that absorb moisture and outer layers that are windproof and waterproof are best.</li> 
 <li>Make sure kids come indoors regularly to warm up.</li> 
 <li>Change kids out of wet clothing or shoes as soon as possible.</li> 
 <li>If you travel to a remote area, make sure you have proper supplies in case of emergencies and let family or friends know your travel plans.</li> 
 <li>Take a first-aid and <a>CPR</a> class to learn what to do in an emergency.</li> 
</ul> 
<h3>What Is Frostnip?</h3> 
<p><strong>Frostnip</strong> is a milder form of cold injury. It usually affects areas of skin exposed to the cold, such as the cheeks, nose, ears, fingers, and toes, leaving them red and numb or tingly. Frostnip can be treated at home and gets better with rewarming.</p> 
<h3>How Is Frostnip Treated?</h3> 
<p>Bring your child indoors right away. Then:</p> 
<ul class="kh_longline_list"> 
 <li>Remove all wet clothing. Wet clothes draw heat away from the body.</li> 
 <li>Place chilled parts of the body in warm (not hot) water for 20 to 30 minutes until all sensation returns. Don't let your child control the water temperature during rewarming. Numb hands won't feel the heat and can be severely burned by water that is too hot. You also can use your body heat to rewarm cold areas.</li> 
 <li>Don't use heating pads, stoves, fireplaces, or radiators to rewarm because the affected skin can be numb and easily burn.</li> 
</ul> 
<p>Call your doctor if sensation does not return or your child has signs of frostbite.</p>

 <h3>What Is a Seizure?</h3> 
 <p>A seizure (SEE-zhur) is unusual electrical activity in the brain that can cause changes in behavior, movement, or feelings. Normally, electrical activity in the brain involves neurons (nerve cells) in different areas sending signals at different times. During a seizure, many neurons fire all at once.</p> 
 <p>Not all kids who have had one seizure will have another. <strong><a>Epilepsy</a></strong> is when someone has repeated seizures. Some kids will outgrow seizures.</p> 
 <h3>What Happens in a Seizure?</h3> 
 <p>Normally, electrical activity in the brain involves neurons (nerve cells) in different areas sending signals at different times. During a seizure, many neurons fire all at once.</p> 
 <h3>What Are the Different Types of Seizures?</h3> 
 <p>Some seizures affect both sides of the brain, while others involve only one side.</p> 
 <p>Generalized seizures affect both sides of the brain. Generalized seizure types include:</p> 
 <ul> 
  <li><a>generalized tonic-clonic seizures</a></li> 
  <li><a>absence seizures</a></li> 
  <li>atonic seizures</li> 
  <li>tonic seizures</li> 
  <li><a>myoclonic seizures</a></li> 
 </ul> 
 <p>Focal seizures affect a single area in one side of the brain. Focal seizures types include:</p> 
 <ul> 
  <li><a>focal aware seizures</a></li> 
  <li><a>focal impaired awareness seizures</a></li> 
  <li>focal to bilateral generalized tonic-clonic seizures</li> 
 </ul> 
 <p>Some people have both focal and generalized seizures.</p> 
 <h3>What Are the Signs &amp; Symptoms of a Seizure?</h3> 
 <p>Signs and symptoms of seizures depend on what kind of seizure someone has. They may stare into space or have jerking movements in part of their body or the whole body. Some people may show no signs at all.</p> 
 <h3>What Happens After a Seizure?</h3> 
 <p>After a seizure, the person may feel confused, tired, have a headache, or have other symptoms. This is called the postictal (post-IK-tul) phase. It usually lasts just a few minutes, but can be longer.</p> 
 <h3>What Causes Seizures?</h3> 
 <p>The most common type of seizure in children is from a fever (called a <strong><a>febrile seizure</a></strong>). Other causes include infections, low blood sodium, medicines, drug use (amphetamines or cocaine), brain injury or a tumor, and genetic changes. Sometimes, a seizure's cause is never found.</p> 
 <h3>How Are Seizures Diagnosed?</h3> 
 <p>If a child has a seizure, doctors will look for a cause. Kids who’ve had a seizure might need to see a pediatric neurologist (a doctor who specializes in brain, spine, and nervous system problems). Tests done can include:</p> 
 <ul> 
  <li>blood tests and urine (pee) tests to look for infections or illnesses</li> 
  <li><a>EEG</a> to measure brain wave activity</li> 
  <li>VEEG, or video electroencephalography (EEG with video recording)</li> 
  <li><a>CAT scan</a>, <a>MRI</a>, and <a>PET/MRI</a> scans to get very detailed images of the brain</li> 
 </ul> 
 <h3>How Are Seizures Treated?</h3> 
 <p>How doctors treat seizures depends on their cause (if known) and the type of seizure. Some won’t need any treatment.</p> 
 <p>Medicines can help with many types of seizures. If medicine doesn’t work, other treatments are available.</p> 
 <h3>How Can Parents Help?</h3> 
 <p>If your child had a seizure, talk to the doctor about:</p> 
 <ul> 
  <li>any medicines your child should take</li> 
  <li>any “triggers” (such as fever, flashing lights, hunger, lack of sleep, or medicines) that can make a seizure more likely</li> 
  <li>any precautions your child should take while swimming or bathing</li> 
  <li>whether your child should wear a medical ID bracelet</li> 
  <li>whether your child needs to see a neurologist</li> 
  <li>if it’s OK for your teen to drive</li> 
  <li>how to keep your child safe <a>during a seizure</a>. Share this information with caregivers, coaches, and staff at your child’s school.</li> 
 </ul> 
 <p>If your child has another seizure, keep a record of:</p> 
 <ul> 
  <li>when it happened</li> 
  <li>how long it lasted</li> 
  <li>what happened right before the seizure</li> 
  <li>what happened during and after the seizure</li> 
 </ul> 
 <p>This information will help the doctor find what’s causing the seizures and decide on the best treatment.</p> 
 <h3>What Else Should I Know?</h3> 
 <p>If your child has seizures, reassure them that they’re not alone. Your doctor and the care team can answer questions and offer support. They also might be able to recommend a local support group. Online organizations can help too, such as:</p> 
 <ul> 
  <li><a>Epilepsy Foundation</a></li> 
  <li><a>CDC – Managing Epilepsy</a></li> 
 </ul>

          <p>What does water safety in the <a>bathroom</a> mean? We know to be hands-on when <a>bathing a baby</a> and to supervise when a preschooler takes a bath. But did you know that:</p> 
<ul class="kh_longline_list"> 
 <li>Among children 1–14, <a>drowning</a> is the second leading cause of accidental death, behind motor vehicle crashes.</li> 
 <li>Babies under age 1 who drown most often do so in a bathtub, bucket, or toilet.</li> 
</ul> 
<h3>How Can I Protect My Child?</h3> 
<p>The most important safety rule is: <strong>Never leave a young child unattended in the bathroom.</strong> This is especially important during bathing. Even a child who appears to be well propped in a safety tub or bath ring can slip down and drown. This can happen in seconds. Most bathtub drownings or accidental burns happen when a child is left unattended, even briefly.</p> 
<p>Water temperature also is important. Hot water can be dangerous, particularly for kids younger than 5. Their skin is thinner than older kids' and adults', so can burn more easily. Just 3 seconds of exposure to tap water that's 140°F (60°C) can cause a <a>third-degree burn</a>.</p> 
<p>You can reduce the risk of scalding by setting the water heater thermostat in your home to 120°F (49°C) and by always testing the water with your wrist or elbow before placing your child in the bath.</p> 
<p><strong>Preventing slips.</strong> Bathtubs can be slippery places. To keep kids safe, you can put anti-skid strips on the bottom of the tub or use a plastic bath mat that adheres to the tub. Put a rubber cover (or a washcloth) over the faucet to avoid injuries if your child bumps into it.</p> 
<p>Eventually, kids want to take unsupervised baths. Kids mature at different rates. Some might be ready to be left alone in the tub at age 6 or 7, while others need mom or dad nearby longer. Of course, older kids and teens should be given privacy in the bathroom.</p> 
<ul> 
 <li>Read more about <a>bathtub safety</a>.</li> 
</ul> 
<p><strong>Toilets.</strong> Bathtubs aren't the only bathroom water hazard. To keep young kids safe, install a toilet-lid locking device and keep bathroom doors closed at all times. (Or you may want to install a doorknob cover.) And promptly wipe up any water spills, whether from the tub, sink, or toilet to prevent falls.</p>

          <h3>Medicine Safety</h3> 
<p>Giving kids medicine safely can be complicated. And many parents feel the pressure when a young child needs a medicine, knowing that giving too much or too little could cause serious side effects.</p> 
<p>Using medicines safely means knowing when they're needed — and when they're not. Always check with your doctor if you're not sure.</p> 
<p>Often, home care is the best bet for a quick recovery. For instance, kids who have&nbsp;<a>the flu</a> or a <a>cold</a> should:</p> 
<ul> 
 <li>get lots of rest</li> 
 <li>drink plenty of clear fluids (such as water, juice, and broth) to avoid <a>dehydration</a></li> 
</ul> 
<p>If your child has a stuffy nose, saline (saltwater) drops can thin nasal secretions. A cool-mist humidifier or a warm-air vaporizer keeps moisture in the air, helping to loosen congestion. If you use a humidifier or vaporizer, clean and dry it well every day to prevent the build-up of bacteria and mold.</p> 
<h3>What to Know</h3> 
<p>To safely use prescription or over-the-counter (OTC) medicines, talk with your doctor or <a>pharmacist</a> before giving them to your child.</p> 
<p>When giving your child medicines, you'll need to know:</p> 
<ul> 
 <li>the name and purpose of the medicine</li> 
 <li>how much, how often, and for how long the medicine should be taken</li> 
 <li>how the medicine should be given. For example: taken by mouth; breathed into the lungs; inserted into the ears, eyes, or rectum; or applied to the skin</li> 
 <li>any special instructions, like whether the medicine should be taken with or without food</li> 
 <li>how the medicine is stored</li> 
 <li>how long the medicine can be stored safely before it needs to be discarded</li> 
 <li>common side effects or reactions</li> 
 <li>interactions with other medicines your child takes</li> 
 <li>what happens if your child misses a dose</li> 
</ul> 
<p>Other things to know:</p> 
<ul class="kh_longline_list"> 
 <ul class="kh_longline_list"> 
  <li>Because the dosages of prescription and OTC medicines depend on a patient's weight, make sure the doctor and pharmacist have updated information about your child's weight and age. Too little medicine can be ineffective and too much could be harmful. Also, different medicines have different concentrations of ingredients. So always check the bottle and ask the pharmacist if you have questions.</li> 
  <li>Make sure the doctor and pharmacist know if your child has any allergies or takes other medicines regularly.</li> 
  <li>Sometimes, medicines are given on an as-needed basis such as for pain or discomfort. OTC drugs that relieve symptoms like aches, pains, or fever (like <a>acetaminophen</a> and <a>ibuprofen</a>) should be used as your doctor recommends.</li> 
  <li><strong>Do not give cough or cold medicines to your child unless the doctor says it's OK, especially to kids under 6 years old</strong>. These products offer little benefit to young children and can have serious side effects. Many cough and cold products for children have more than one ingredient, which might increase the chances of accidental overdose if taken with another medicine.</li> 
  <li>Always talk to your doctor first to be sure an OTC medicine is safe for your child.</li> 
  <li>Many prescription medicines should be taken until finished as prescribed by the doctor — even if your child feels better before that. For example, antibiotics kill <span>bacteria</span> , so it's important to finish all doses even after symptoms stop. Otherwise, the infection could come back.</li> 
 </ul> 
</ul> 
<h3>Aspirin Alert!</h3> 
<p>Never give aspirin to kids, especially during viral illnesses. Using aspirin during an illness caused by a <script type="text/javascript" id="splatJS_virus_T" name="splat" src="/content/kidshealth/us/en/parents/splats/virus.js"></script><script type="text/javascript" id="splatDW_virus_T">document.write(def_virus_T);</script>
 <noscript class="rs_skip">
  virus</noscript>(such as the flu, <a>chickenpox</a>, or an upper respiratory infection) can cause <a>Reye syndrome</a>. This potentially life-threatening disease can cause nausea, vomiting, and extreme tiredness that progresses to a coma.</p> 
<p>Some OTC medicines (including some that treat headache and nausea) contain aspirin. So always read labels and check with your doctor or pharmacist before using them. Also, some aspirin-containing medicines use words other than aspirin, such as salicylate or acetylsalicylate. Avoid those too.</p> 
<h3>Medicine Safety Basics</h3> 
<p>For safe medicine use:</p> 
<ul class="kh_longline_list"> 
 <li>Always check with your doctor if you're unsure whether symptoms need medical treatment.</li> 
 <li>Never use leftover medicines. For example, pharmacists will sometimes dispense more liquid medicine than is needed in case some is spilled or measured incorrectly. If you have leftover liquid medicine, throw it out. For medicines taken as needed, keep an eye on the expiration date to make sure you don't give an outdated medicine.</li> 
 <li>Never give your child medicines that have been prescribed to someone else, whether it's an adult or child. Even if two people have the same illness, they may need different drugs with different dosages and directions.</li> 
 <li>Never give a child a medicine that is meant for adults.</li> 
 <li>Check with your doctor or pharmacist before giving two types of medicines with the same ingredients to your child.</li> 
 <li>When buying OTC medicines, check the packaging for possible tampering, and don't use any medicine in a cut, torn, or sliced package. Check the expiration date too.</li> 
 <li>Work with a local pharmacist so that your family's medicine history is in a central location. Consult your pharmacist if you have questions about any medicine, including information about possible side effects or reactions.</li> 
</ul> 
<h3>Giving Medicines to Kids</h3> 
<p><strong>Double check.</strong> First, check to make sure you have the correct prescription. Many prescription and medicine bottles look the same, so make sure your child's name is on the label and it's the medicine that the doctor recommended or prescribed.</p> 
<p>Be especially careful when reaching into the medicine cabinet in the middle of the night — it's easy to grab the wrong bottle when you're sleepy.</p> 
<p><strong>Read all instructions.</strong> Both prescription and OTC medicines usually come with printed inserts about common side effects and further instructions on how to take the medicine. Be sure to read all information carefully before beginning the medicine. The label may instruct you to shake a liquid medicine before using so that the active ingredients are evenly distributed throughout it. Call the doctor or pharmacist if you have any questions.</p> 
<p><strong>With or without food?</strong> All prescription medicines have labels or instructions about how to take them. For example, "take with food or milk" means the medicine may upset an empty stomach or that food may improve its absorption. In this case, your child should eat a snack or meal right before or after taking the medicine.</p> 
<p>Another common instruction on prescription medicines is "take on an empty stomach," in which case your child should take the medicine 1 hour before or 2 hours after a meal because food may prevent the medicine from working properly or may delay or reduce its absorption. Some medicines interact only with certain foods or nutrients, such as dairy products, so be sure to check the label for other instructions.</p> 
<p><strong>The right dose.</strong> Giving the correct dose is important because most medicines need to be taken in a certain amount and at certain times to be effective. The dose will be written on the prescription label or, on OTC medicines, should be printed on the package insert, product box, or product label.</p> 
<p><strong>Measure carefully.</strong> You can dispense medicine in a variety of ways. For babies who can't drink from a cup, try a dosing syringe, which lets you dispense the medicine into your baby's mouth, making it less likely to be spit out. Be careful, though — many come with a small cap on the end that can be a choking hazard to young children. Store a medicine syringe in a safe place out of the reach of kids.</p> 
<p>Other options for young kids are:</p> 
<ul> 
 <li>plastic droppers</li> 
 <li>cylindrical dosing spoons, which have a long handle that's easier for children to grab</li> 
 <li>if your child can drink easily from a cup without spilling, the small dosage cups that come with many medicines</li> 
</ul> 
<p>Never use tableware or a kitchen spoon to measure medicine because these don't provide standard measurements. Instead, get a measuring device designed to deliver accurate medicine doses from your local pharmacy or drugstore.</p> 
<p>Some medicine dispensers for infants and toddlers look like pacifiers. With these, you put the medicine in a small measuring cup attached to a pacifier,&nbsp;and then give the pacifier to the baby to suck. Most of the medicine slips past&nbsp;the taste buds, making it go down easily.</p> 
<p>Whatever method you use, it's important that your child takes all the medicine each time. If a dose is missed, <strong>never</strong> give two doses at once to "catch up."</p> 
<h3>What if My Child Doesn't Want to Take the Medicine?</h3> 
<p>Try these tips to get kids to take "yucky" medicines:</p> 
<ul class="kh_longline_list"> 
 <li>Some kids may prefer it if medicines are chilled. Check with your pharmacist to see if chilling the medicine is safe because refrigeration may alter the effectiveness of some drugs.</li> 
 <li>Before mixing a medicine with food or liquid, check with your pharmacist to make sure that it won't harm its effectiveness. Mixing the medicine with a small amount of liquid or soft food (such as applesauce) may make it more appealing. Use only a small amount of food and make sure your child eats all it to get the complete dose of medicine. Avoid mixing medicine in a baby's bottle — a baby who doesn't finish the bottle might not get all it.</li> 
 <li>If you use a syringe, try squirting the medicine (a little bit at a time) on the inside of the child's cheek, where there are no taste buds.</li> 
 <li>If your child has trouble swallowing a tablet or capsule medicine, ask your pharmacist if you can crush it and mix it with soft food (such as pudding or applesauce). (The effectiveness of some drugs may be harmed by crushing.)</li> 
 <li>Some pharmacies offer flavorings such as chocolate, cherry, grape, and bubblegum to make drugs like antibiotics and cough syrup more appealing to kids. Ask your doctor or pharmacist about the safety of flavoring in medicine, especially if your child has an allergy to dyes or sweeteners.</li> 
</ul> 
<p>Never call medicine candy to try to get your child to take it. This can backfire, and a child could accidentally overdose by taking dangerous medicine thinking it's a tasty treat. Instead, explain that medicine can make your child feel better, but must always be taken with you or another caregiver supervising.</p> 
<p>If your child spits out or vomits medicine, don't give another dose — call your doctor for instructions.</p> 
<p>And, if your child isn't getting better or gets worse while taking the medicine, talk to your doctor.</p> 
<h3>What About Side Effects?</h3> 
<p>After giving your child a dose of medicine, be on the lookout for side effects or allergic reactions. The pharmacist or product packaging may warn you about specific side effects, such as drowsiness or hyperactivity.</p> 
<p>If your child has side effects such as a rash, hives, vomiting, or diarrhea, contact your doctor or pharmacist. Penicillin and other antibiotics are among the most common prescription drugs to cause an allergic reaction.</p> 
<p>If your child develops wheezing, has trouble breathing, or difficulty swallowing&nbsp;after taking a medicine, seek emergency help by calling 911 or going to the emergency department immediately. These could be symptoms of a serious allergic reaction that requires emergency care.</p> 
<p>Sometimes children have unusual reactions to medicines, such as hyperactivity from diphenhydramine, which usually makes adults feel sleepy. Tell your doctor if this happens.</p> 
<h3>How Should We Store Medicine?</h3> 
<p>Be as careful about storing medicines as you are about giving the correct dose. Read the medicine's instructions. Some drugs need to be refrigerated, but most should be stored in a cool, dry location away from direct sunlight.</p> 
<p>Your bathroom's medicine cabinet is a poor choice for storing most medicines because of the humidity and moisture from the tub or shower. Instead, store medicines in their original containers in a dry, locked location that kids can't reach. Above-counter kitchen cabinets are great spots if they are away from the stove, sink, and hot appliances.</p> 
<p>Child-resistant caps can be hard even for adults to open. But protect your kids by re-locking and recapping child-resistant bottles properly. Kids can sometimes open the cap, so it's important to lock away all medicines. If any visitors to your house have medicine in their bags, purses, or coat pockets, make sure they put those out of sight and out of reach.</p> 
<p>If your child accidentally takes medicine, call the Poison Control Center right away for guidance at 1-800-222-1222. Put this number in your cellphone and post it where others can see it in your home.</p> 
<h3>How Can We Safely Dispose of Medicines?</h3> 
<p>The best way to dispose of unwanted medicines is through a medicine disposal site.</p> 
<p>The U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) periodically hosts National Prescription Drug Take-Back events. Temporary collection sites are set up in communities for safe disposal of prescription drugs. There are also permanent sites in many areas. Visit the <a href="https://apps.deadiversion.usdoj.gov/pubdispsearch/spring/main?execution=e1s1">DEA website</a> to find a disposal site near you.</p> 
<p>If you can't dispose of your medicines at a disposal site, keep these suggestions in mind:</p> 
<ul class="kh_longline_list"> 
 <li>When disposing of medicines, make sure they stay out of the reach of children and don't contaminate the environment.</li> 
 <li>Check the package for specific instructions on how to dispose of the medicine. Do not dispose of medicines in the toilet unless the package says it's OK.</li> 
 <li>Break down tablets or capsules and mix them with another substance, like used coffee grounds or kitty litter. That way, kids and pets won't try to get to the medicine. Next, put the mixture in a bag or container and seal it closed, then toss it into a garbage can.</li> 
 <li>Return the medicine to a local pharmacy. Many pharmacies take back expired pharmaceuticals. Each pharmacy has a different policy, so contact yours to see if it will accept them.</li> 
 <li>Local household hazardous-waste collection facilities often take expired medicines. These are the places where antifreeze, oil, and used batteries are taken for proper disposal. Each facility has a different policy about unused medicine, so call first.</li> 
 <li>Take special care to dispose of unused <a>pain medicines</a> promptly to prevent the potential for theft/abuse.</li> 
 <li>Put needles in the trash in a thick plastic container (like a laundry detergent container) or a metal can (like a coffee can) where the lid has been carefully secured.</li>

          <h3>Why Is Water Safety Important?</h3> 
<p>Water safety isn't just about keeping kids safe in the <a>pool</a>. <a>Bathroom water safety</a> is also important. And things you might not think about — like catchment ponds, drainage ditches and runoff areas in your neighborhood — can be a hazard.</p> 
<h4>Drowning Facts</h4> 
<p>In the U.S.:</p> 
<ul class="kh_longline_list"> 
 <li><a>Drowning</a> is a leading cause of injury-related death in children, especially those younger than 4 and teens.</li> 
 <li>Most kids with nonfatal drowning injuries need <a>emergency room</a> care. Half of them will need further care, often in a hospital.</li> 
 <li>Surviving a drowning can leave someone with severe brain damage — 5%-10% of childhood drowning cases result in long-term disability, such as persistent vegetative state or quadriplegia (the loss of use of all four limbs and torso).</li> 
</ul> 
<p>How kids drown varies by age:</p> 
<ul class="kh_longline_list"> 
 <li>Under age 1: Babies most often drown in <a>bathtubs</a>, buckets, and toilets.</li> 
 <li>1–4 years old: Young children most often drown in swimming pools, hot tubs, and spas.</li> 
 <li>Older kids, teens, and young adults: Most drownings in these age groups happen in <a>natural bodies of water</a>, such as lakes and rivers.</li> 
</ul> 
<p>So it's important for parents to know about how to protect kids, avoid risks, and respond in an emergency.</p> 
<h3>Water Safety Basics</h3> 
<p><strong>Supervision is rule #1.</strong> Kids must be watched whenever they're around water. This is true whether the water is in a bathtub, a wading pool, an ornamental fish pond, a swimming pool, a spa, an ocean, or a lake.</p> 
<p>Young children are especially at risk. They can drown in less than 2 inches (6 centimeters) of water. That means drowning can happen in a sink, toilet bowl, fountains, buckets, inflatable pools, or small bodies of standing water around your home, such as ditches filled with rainwater.</p> 
<p>Always watch children closely when they're in or near any water, no matter what their swimming skills. Even kids who know how to swim can be at risk for drowning. For instance, a child could slip and fall on the pool deck, lose consciousness, and fall into the pool and possibly drown.</p> 
<p>Young kids and weak swimmers should have an adult swimmer within arm's reach to provide "touch supervision."</p> 
<p><strong>Swimming lessons.</strong> Swimming lessons are an important part of water safety. Kids can start taking them at age 1. Younger kids often begin with water survival skills training (like learning how to roll onto their back and float). Along with swimming lessons, this training can reduce the risk of drowning in kids ages 1–4. Kids and parents often can take these classes together. Check local recreation centers for classes taught by a qualified instructor. If you don't know how to swim, consider taking lessons.</p>

</ul> 
<h3>What to Do in an Emergency</h3> 
<p>If a child is missing, always check the pool or other body of water first. Survival depends on a quick rescue and restarting breathing as soon as possible:</p> 
<ul class="kh_longline_list"> 
 <li>If you find a child in the water, get the child out while calling loudly for help. If someone else is nearby, have them call 911.&nbsp;</li> 
 <li>Check to make sure the child's air passages are clear. If the child is not breathing, start <a>CPR</a> if you are trained to do so. Follow the instructions the 911 emergency operator gives.</li> 
 <li>If you think the child has a neck injury, such as from diving: 
  <ul> 
   <li>Keep the child on his or her back.</li> 
   <li>Brace the neck and shoulders with your hands and forearms to help keep the neck from moving until emergency help arrives. This can help prevent further injury to the spine.</li> 
   <li>Keep the child still and speak in calm tones to keep the child comforted.</li> 
  </ul> </li> 
</ul>

          <p>A well-stocked first-aid kit, kept within easy reach, is a must for every home. Having the right supplies ahead of time will help you handle an <a>emergency</a> at a moment's notice. <strong>Keep a first-aid kit in your home and one in each car.</strong> Also be sure to bring a first-aid kit on family vacations.</p> 
<p></p> 
<p>You can buy a first aid kit at drugstores or a local Red Cross office, or make one of your own. If you make one, use containers that are roomy, sturdy, easy to carry, and simple to open. Plastic tackle boxes or containers for storing art supplies are ideal because they're lightweight, have handles, and offer a lot of space and separate sections.</p> 
<h3>What Should a First-Aid Kit Include?</h3> 
<p>Put these in each of your first-aid kits:</p> 
<ul> 
 <li>an up-to-date first-aid manual</li> 
 <li>a list of emergency phone numbers</li> 
 <li>sterile gauze pads of different sizes</li> 
 <li>adhesive tape</li> 
 <li>adhesive bandages (Band-Aids) in several sizes</li> 
 <li>elastic bandage</li> 
 <li>a splint</li> 
 <li>antiseptic wipes</li> 
 <li>soap</li> 
 <li>antibiotic ointment</li> 
 <li>antiseptic solution (like hydrogen peroxide)</li> 
 <li>hydrocortisone cream (1%)</li> 
 <li>acetaminophen and ibuprofen</li> 
 <li>extra prescription medicines (if the family is going on vacation)</li> 
 <li>tweezers</li> 
 <li>sharp scissors</li> 
 <li>safety pins</li> 
 <li>disposable instant cold packs</li> 
 <li>calamine lotion</li> 
 <li>alcohol wipes or ethyl alcohol</li> 
 <li>thermometer</li> 
 <li><a>tooth preservation kit</a></li> 
 <li>plastic non-latex gloves (at least 2 pairs)</li> 
 <li>flashlight and extra batteries</li> 
 <li>a blanket</li> 
 <li>mouthpiece for giving CPR (you can get one from your local Red Cross)</li> 
</ul> 
<p>Also keep a blanket stored with your kit.</p> 
<p>After you've stocked your first-aid kits:</p> 
<ul class="kh_longline_list"> 
 <li>Read the first-aid manual so you'll understand how to use what's in your kits. (If your kids are old enough to understand, review the main points with them.) Read the manual from time to time and check to see if it is up to date.</li> 
 <li>Store first-aid kits out of children's reach but where adults can easily get them.</li> 
 <li>Check the kits regularly. Replace missing items or anything that has expired.</li> 
 <li>Make sure babysitters and other caregivers know where the kit is and how to use it.</li> 
 <li>Check the flashlight batteries to make sure they work.</li> 
 <li>If you're flying, pack the first-aid kit in your checked luggage. Many of the items won't be permitted in carry-on bags.</li>

            Dealing With Addiction
          </button>

          <p>Jason's life is beginning to unravel. His grades have slipped, he's moody, he doesn't talk to his friends, and he has stopped showing up for practice. Jason's friends know he has been experimenting with drugs and now they're worried he has become addicted.</p> 
<p>Defining an addiction is tricky, and knowing how to handle one is even harder.</p> 
<h3>What Are Substance Abuse and Addiction?</h3> 
<p>The difference between substance abuse and addiction is very slight. Substance abuse means using an illegal substance or using a legal substance in the wrong way. Addiction begins as abuse, or using a substance like marijuana or cocaine.</p> 
<p>You can abuse a <a>drug</a> (or <a>alcohol</a>) without having an addiction. For example, just because Sara smoked pot a few times doesn't mean that she has an addiction, but it does mean that she's abusing a drug — and that could lead to an addiction.</p> 
<p>People can get addicted to all sorts of substances. When we think of addiction, we usually think of alcohol or illegal drugs. But people become addicted to medicines, cigarettes, even glue.</p> 
<p>Some substances are more addictive than others: Drugs like crack or heroin are so addictive that they might only be used once or twice before the user loses control.</p> 
<p><strong>Addiction</strong> means a person has no control over whether he or she uses a drug or drinks. Someone who's addicted to cocaine has grown so used to the drug that he or she <em>has</em> to have it. Addiction can be physical, psychological, or both.</p> 
<h3>Physical Addiction</h3> 
<p>Being physically addicted means a person's body becomes dependent on a particular substance (even smoking is physically addictive). It also means building <strong>tolerance</strong> to that substance, so that a person needs a larger dose than ever before to get the same effects.</p> 
<p>Someone who is physically addicted and stops using a substance like drugs, alcohol, or cigarettes may experience <strong>withdrawal</strong> symptoms. Common symptoms of withdrawal are diarrhea, shaking, and generally feeling awful.</p> 
<h3>Psychological Addiction</h3> 
<p>Psychological addiction happens when the cravings for a drug are psychological or emotional. People who are psychologically addicted feel overcome by the <strong>desire</strong> to have a drug. They may lie or steal to get it.</p> 
<p>A person crosses the line between abuse and addiction when he or she is no longer trying the drug to have fun or get high, but has come to depend on it. His or her whole life centers around the need for the drug. An addicted person — whether it's a physical or psychological addiction or both — no longer feels like there is a choice in taking a substance.</p> 
<h3>Signs of Addiction</h3> 
<p>The most obvious sign of an addiction is the need to have a particular drug or substance. However, many other signs can suggest a possible addiction, such as changes in mood or weight loss or gain. (These also are signs of other conditions too, though, such as <a>depression</a> or <a>eating disorders</a>.)</p> 
<p>Signs that you or someone you know may have a drug or alcohol addiction include:</p> 
<p><strong>Psychological signals:</strong></p> 
<ul> 
 <li>use of drugs or alcohol as a way to forget problems or to relax</li> 
 <li>withdrawal or keeping secrets from family and friends</li> 
 <li>loss of interest in activities that used to be important</li> 
 <li>problems with schoolwork, such as slipping grades or absences</li> 
 <li>changes in friendships, such as hanging out only with friends who use drugs</li> 
 <li>spending a lot of time figuring out how to get drugs</li> 
 <li>stealing or selling belongings to be able to afford drugs</li> 
 <li>failed attempts to stop taking drugs or drinking</li> 
 <li>anxiety, anger, or depression</li> 
 <li>mood swings</li> 
</ul> 
<p><strong>Physical signals:</strong></p> 
<ul> 
 <li>changes in sleeping habits</li> 
 <li>feeling shaky or sick when trying to stop</li> 
 <li>needing to take more of the substance to get the same effect</li> 
 <li>changes in eating habits, including weight loss or gain</li> 
</ul>

<h3>Getting Help</h3> 
<p>If you think that you or someone you care about is addicted to drugs or alcohol, recognizing the problem is the first step in getting help.</p> 
<p>Many people think they can kick the problem on their own, but that rarely works. Find someone you trust to talk to. It may help to talk to a friend or someone your own age at first, but a supportive and understanding adult is your best option for getting help. If you can't talk to your parents, you might want to approach a school counselor, relative, doctor, favorite teacher, or religious leader.</p> 
<p>Unfortunately, overcoming addiction is not easy. Quitting drugs or drinking is probably going to be one of the hardest things you or your friend have ever done. It's not a sign of weakness if you need professional help from a trained drug counselor or therapist. Most people who try to kick a drug or alcohol problem need professional assistance or a treatment program to do so.</p> 
<h3>Tips for Recovery</h3> 
<p>After you start a treatment program, try these tips to make the road to recovery less bumpy:</p> 
<ul class="kh_longline_list"> 
 <li><strong>Tell your friends about your decision to stop using drugs.</strong>&nbsp;True friends will respect your decision. This might mean that you need to find a new group of friends who will be 100% supportive. Unless everyone decides to kick their drug habit at once, you probably won't be able to hang out with the friends you did drugs with.</li> 
 <li><strong>Ask your friends or family to be available when you need them.</strong> You might need to call someone in the middle of the night just to talk. If you're going through a tough time, don't try to handle things on your own — accept the help your family and friends offer.</li> 
 <li><strong>Accept invitations</strong> <strong>only to events that you know won't involve drugs or alcohol.</strong> Going to the movies is probably safe, but you may want to skip a Friday night party until you're feeling more secure. Plan activities that don't involve drugs. Go to the movies, try bowling, or take an art class with a friend.</li> 
 <li><strong>Have a plan about what you'll do if you find yourself in a place with drugs or alcohol.</strong> The temptation will be there sometimes. If you know how you're going to handle it, you'll be OK. Establish a plan with your parents, siblings, or other supportive friends and adults so that if you call home using a code, they'll know that your call is a signal you need a ride out of there.</li> 
 <li><strong>Remind yourself that having an addiction doesn't make a person&nbsp;bad or weak.</strong> If you fall back into old patterns (backslide) a bit, talk to an adult as soon as possible. There's nothing to be ashamed about, but it's important to get help soon so that all of the hard work you put into your recovery is not lost.</li> 
</ul> 
<h3>Helping a Friend With Addiction</h3> 
<p>If you're worried about a friend who has an addiction, you can&nbsp;use these tips to help him or her. For example, let your friend know that you are available to talk or offer your support. If you notice a friend backsliding, talk about it openly and ask what you can do to help.</p> 
<p>If your friend is going back to drugs or drinking and won't accept your help, don't be afraid to talk to a nonthreatening, understanding adult, like your parent or school counselor. It may seem like you're ratting your friend out, but it's the best support you can offer.</p> 
<p>Above all, offer a friend who's battling an addiction lots of encouragement and praise. It may seem corny, but hearing that you care is just the kind of motivation your friend needs.</p> 
<h3>Staying Clean</h3> 
<p>Recovering from a drug or alcohol addiction doesn't end with a 6-week treatment program. It's a lifelong process. Many people find that joining a support group can help them stay clean. There are support groups specifically for teens and younger people. You'll meet people who have gone through the same experiences you have, and you'll be able to participate in real-life discussions about drugs that you won't hear in your school's health class.</p> 
<p>Many people find that helping others is also the best way to help themselves. Your understanding of how difficult the recovery process can be will help you to support others — both teens and adults — who are battling an addiction.</p> 
<p>If you do have a relapse, recognizing the problem as soon as possible is critical. Get help right away so that you don't undo all the hard work you put into your initial recovery. And, if you do have a relapse, don't ever be afraid to ask for help!</p>
